ldesc: "SIDPLAY emulates the Sound Interface Device chip (MOS 6581,
commonly called SID) and the Micro Processor Unit (MOS 6510) of the
Commodore 64 on your computer. It is a platform independent software
which emulates these hardware components. Therefore it is able to load
and execute C64 machine code programs which produce music or sound."
